
Welcome!

In this experiment you will be shown a series of paragraphs, followed by a line that summarizes the upshot of what happened.

Please read each paragraph and following line silently to yourself first. When you are 
ready to record, press a button.

Then please record only the final line (two sentences) as naturally as possible and try to imagine you are
describing a real scenario to someone you're talking to.

The recordings will be played to people who will have to then answer questions about what happened.

After recording each story, you will be asked how natural the *last sentence* sounded given the preceding story.

If you have any questions, ask the experimenter now. 
Otherwise, press any key to start.

Thank you!
