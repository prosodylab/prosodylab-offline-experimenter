prosodylab-offline-experimenter
=======================

This repository is now defunct (and renamed with 'offline' middle name). We moved to online experiments using javascript. 
Please be aware that the last time we used the scripts in fall 2019, the Psychtoolbox was no longer compatible with current Mac operating systems (we used a computer running Sierra to get it to work reliably.).

## Usage
For these scripts to run, you need matlab and have to have the [Psychtoolbox](http://psychtoolbox.org/) installed.

To set up an experiment, copy the entire 'experiment' folder, and adjust the experiment.m script to read in your spreadsheet etc. Minor knowledge of matlab to do these adjustments, more knowledge of matlab is recommended since the scripts are still buggy.

The folder comes with some example scripts.

Information on how to format your experiment spreadsheet can be found [here](https://github.com/prosodylab/prosodylab-experimenter/blob/master/instructions.Rmd).
